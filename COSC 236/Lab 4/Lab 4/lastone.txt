"Writing   is     an                exercise."You get     better and     faster with practice.If    you    were    going to run a marathon a year from now,would          you wait for    months and then    run 26 miles cold?No, you would build up slowly, running most days.You might start on the         flats and work up to moredemanding and difficult terrain. To become a writer, write.Don't wait         for that book manuscript or that monster     external-review reportto work        on your writing.
